## Compile / Run
1 - install golang from golang.org for your platform
2 - download repo
3 - run `go build .`
4 - have `chdman` from the MAME project installed somewhere in your path.

Try it in a test folder first. Program will unzip any .zip files, and convert the ISO or CUE/BIN files in it to CHD using chdman.
